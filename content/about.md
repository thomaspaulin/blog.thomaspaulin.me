I am a software developer by trade, an aerospace enthusiast by nature, and a self-proclaimed lifelong learner. 

I currently reside in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

# What is this Site?
This site serves as a place to host blog posts, essays, project build logs, and other content worth sharing with the world.

[Hugo Martins](https://hugomartins.io/) has inspired its general theme, and it was his template I tweaked slightly to produce this website.
