Herein you will find the thought process behind this blog site's theme.

## General
I want a very minimal design which displays the bare minimum information in a crisp and intuitive manner.

## Proposed Colour Palette
- Primary - white, black, light grey
- Accent - A bold primary/secondary colour

### Colour Palette
[Possibility #1](https://coolors.co/1c1c1c-7c7a7a-fcf7f8-ffffff-ff5d73), [Possibility #2](https://coolors.co/cfdbd5-e8eddf-f5cb5c-242423-333533), [Possibility #3](https://coolors.co/b3efb2-edf1f2-f5cb5c-242423-333533), [Possibility #4](https://colorhunt.co/palette/166073).
These all take the approach of a bright colour on a white background for the vibrance and friendliness that brings.

The [end result](https://coolors.co/7c7a7a-1c1c1c-ffffff-b91400-01baef) was reminiscent of Luxembourg's flag with some dark grey and black thrown in.

I really liked the warmness and positivity of a yellow based theme, however the contrast was insufficient for readability and accessibility purposes. In order to create adequate contrast between the link text and the background a darker primary colour, the rest you are seeing, was chosen. The blue then followed as an accent because of the complementary nature. 

I am considering a night mode theme because the black/grey background provides suffieint contrast with the bright colours. However, that doesn't fit with the frosted glass aesthetic I am ultimately going for in the end.

For some guidelines I tried to adhere to, see [Wix](https://www.wix.com/blog/2017/10/how-to-choose-the-perfect-color-palette-for-your-business), [Invision App](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/quick-guide-color-palette/), and [Website Builder Expert](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/how-to-choose-color-for-your-website/)'s articles on building a colour palette for a website.

## Fonts
### Criteria
1. Sans serif
    - Avoid unnecessary elements, only provide exactly what is needed
2. A range of weights for different emphasis
    - Shouldn't feel too oppressive
3. There should be sufficnet space between letters to feel more friendly

#### Possible Parings
1. [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) (headings), [Esteban](https://www.dafontfree.io/esteban-font/) (body/article text)
2. [Futura PT](https://www.fonts.com/font/paratype/futura-pt?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts) (headings), [Museo Slab](https://www.dafontfree.io/museo-slab-font-free/) (body/article text)

With will fall back to the generic sans-serif, and serif font families, respectively.

## Inspiration
- Quantum Break menu
- Mirror's Edge colours
- Assassin's Creed Brotherhood menus
- Modernism & Minimalism design in general

## Layout
### Blog Home Page
Because I'm a fan of pictures speaking for 1000 words, I want the article summaries to have a title, image, date, and initial article text. This will lead to an image heavy page, and thus users will follow the Z pattern when it comes to browsing.

- Primary use case: Reading articles
- Secondary use case: Searching for desired articles
- Third use case: Navigating to my other sites/wiki

Personal website can be a game style main menu, but the blog will be a Quantum Break inspired blog site with the home page displaying the latest articles.

On each page of the blog site will be an icon to return home on the left, and an icon to perform a global search of the blog on the right, alongside the hamburger menu.

Items on the blog home pages will include pictures and will be laid out as list because blog articles are not disparate items.

Each list item will include a picture/thumbnail, title, preview text, and date as above.

### Blog Article Page
The navigation as per the other pages.

The page content will be a central column with the image at some meta information at first, followed by the content itself
