### Project
Door stop

### Lessons Learned
- You can use the create â†’ box instead of needing to create a rectangular sketch and then extruding it. Faster
- Where fillet tool creates rounded edges, the chamfer tool creates bevelled/chamfered edges
- Trim tool (T) can be used to delete lines. Usual when combining shapes and you need to form new profiles
