### Project
Hinged box

### Lessons Learned
- Parameters are mathematical variables
    - Can be single value
    - Can be equations
    - Can reference other parameters
- Can use user parameters in place of measurements of course
- Shell every face of the cube to hollow out the inside. Use section analysis to confirm as in previous videos
- Can use parameter values to create a midplane as one might expect
- The split tool does what its name suggests
- Remove takes the bodies out of the browser, but keeps them in the history
- Double click revolute joint icon to bring up the rotation handle meaning you can open it up and set the position for printing
