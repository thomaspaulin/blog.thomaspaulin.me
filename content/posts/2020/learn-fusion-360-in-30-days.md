# Motivation

3D modelling is a skill I can use for both personal projects, and to add more to my repertoire, however, I hope to learn how to CAD (Autodesk, Solidworks, etc.) so I can one day design aircraft and build experimental aircraft.

# The Process
When searching Google I found a range of posts asking how one might learn CAD and multiple people mentioned Kevin Kennedy. Given he had a 30 day course I thought I'd check out some of his YouTube videos to trial before I bought. After working my way through [one of his lessons]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrHuaHhqHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrHuaHhqHI)) and thoroughly enjoying his teaching style, I decided to work my way through his Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days series. This course can be found on [YouTube]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZwM87-nsYA&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-DR2ZkMaK3YthYLErPxCnT-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZwM87-nsYA&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-DR2ZkMaK3YthYLErPxCnT-)) or you can use his referral link to access the course on [SkillShare]([https://www.skillshare.com/r/user/kevinkennedy](https://www.skillshare.com/r/user/kevinkennedy)), ad-free and support his work.

# Why Fusion 360?
Because it's free for hobbyists, which also means there's many resources available. Despite it taking a top-down approach to assembly as opposed to the bottom-up approach Autodesk Inventor and SolidWorks take, the majority of concepts apply to all CAD software. 

# Daily Log
Here I will be posting my notes from Kevin's videos for each day. Because they will all be under this one article please check back for updates.

## Day 1
### Project
Lego brick
### Lessons Learned
- Sometimes edges don't show up and cannot be used. Use the setting Preferences -> Design -> Auto Project Edges on Reference, to enable projections. If this does not help, try playing with the settings in Display Settings -> Visual Style 
- All edges will turn black when a sketch is fully constrained. The sketch's icon in the Fusion 360 Browser will also have a red padlock on it (this note is not from the day #1 video, but instead the video which lead me to this course)
