# Motivation
Many moons ago I discovered programming when making mods for the game Morrowind. As part of this I briefly touched on 3D modelling in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [3DS Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview) but never progressed beyond a basic level. 
Laters later a part of me wants to learn these skills once more only this time the reason is for 3D printing, designing other hardware focused projects, and to one day model aircraft and cars.
First I need to learn how to use CAD software and with [Fusion 360 being free for hobbyists](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) it's the natural starting point.
In order to begin learning Fusion 360 I've decided to take Kevin Kennedy's Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days course, which is available on [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Learn-Fusion-360-in-30-Days-for-Complete-Beginners-2019/1650486259) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-DR2ZkMaK3YthYLErPxCnT-).

### Why a 30 day challenge? 
Small, consistent progress greatly helps with progression and learning and without obvious stepping stones I have a tendency to aim for overly ambitious projects which are unobtainable by a complete beginner in a reason timespan, thus wasting a significant amount of time and becoming demotivated as explained on the diagram below of challenge vs. ability.

### Why this course? 
Kevin comes with many recommendations, prompting me to watch one of his [beginner friendly videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrHuaHhqHI).
Kevin has a very clear and concise style where he walks you through every step covers most of the questions which might crop up as you watch.
His projects are also real-world objects relevant to hobbyists or makers. This is in contrast with other practice exercises I found - these tended to be geometric shapes constructed by following plans, making the concepts that little bit harder to grasp.
