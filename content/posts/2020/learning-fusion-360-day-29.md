### Project
Render a utility knife (continued)

### Lessons Learned
- Others have likely rendered a similar product before and researched what's the best position for your product, make use of their research by looking up existing renders
- The number of rendering credits you have depends on your Fusion 360 licence

### Completed Project
[Utility knife with rendering environment configured](https://a360.co/3gYVXQz)
