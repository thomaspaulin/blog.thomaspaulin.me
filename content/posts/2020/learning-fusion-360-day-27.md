### Project
Patch a model

### Lessons Learned
- Patch workspace two main purposes
    - Surface has no mass or thickness which can be manipulated
- Patch is useful on surface model bodies
- Downloaded objects might be surface bodies if parametric operations can't be used on them
- Stitch can join surface bodies. If the result forms a solid body then it will be created and the surface bodies will be removed
