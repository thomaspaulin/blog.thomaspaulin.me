### Project
Bike handle bars grip

### Lessons Learned
- Press-pull works on edges and/or faces but extrude works on sketch profiles or planar surfaces
- You can press-pull from an object to use it as where the extrusion starts
- Editing a sketch you've previously done means you can try things out and tweak until you're happy
- You can use shift to select faces (text only?) when in the appearance menu to individually apply textures
