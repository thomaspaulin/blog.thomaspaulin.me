### Project
Assemblies and joints

### Lessons Learned
- "Revert" in toolbar (position) moves a component back to its position
- Capture position is parametric. Can be rolled forwards/backwards and built upon
- Grounding a component will prevent it from moving so it's useful when attaching multiple joints to one component
- To ground a component you must ground the lowest level component within that component's hierarchy, the deepest child component
- Useful to ground at least one component
- As-built joints are useful when importing geometry be it from existing models or otherwise
- Non as-built joints are useful to define position and relative motion all at once
