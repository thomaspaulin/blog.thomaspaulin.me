### Project
Painter's tripod

### Lessons Learned
- By projecting the base sketch and using the projected lines to create the apex sketch, any changes to the original sketch will update the apex one
- Always set up models so you can go back and edit features without causing problems or errors, such as by making use of projections. This saves headaches
- 'To object' extend is useful when extruding cuts to ensure only what is absolutely necessary is cut
