### Project
Paperclip

### Lessons Learned
- Shortcut F is for the MODEL fillet, which only works on 3D models. For 2D sketches use Sketch â†’ Fillet
- Sketch fillets sometimes don't play nice with the sweep. The error for the paperclip was something to do with 'anti-parallel'. To fix this I did each fillet one at a time so that each one was dimensioned rather than letting some be driven
