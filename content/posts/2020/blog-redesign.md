A personal website should say who you are and much like in a conversation, as personal website is so much more than the text written. My [initial design](https://blog.thomaspaulin.me/2020/02/designing-blog.thomaspaulin.me/) was made to be minimal but has ended up feeling bland and sterile, not reflecting my being at all, nor even the clean minimal look I was hoping for in my head. It is for these reasons that I've chosen to undertake a redesign of my personal website to make it a bit more memorable and whilst unifying the design of the home page, and the blog.

# Part One
Initially I wanted to keep the minimalist and modern black on white, frosted glass feeling with bold accent colours but as I began researching how I might acheive this look I stumbled on Typography and graphic design articles. These led me to take a more bold paper-cross-conversation type approach by animating bold and concise text at a speed intended to mimic speech.

I would like to leverage the motion design (animations) so that when a visitor clicks on of the links on the homepage there will be seamless transitions to the website sections with the home page text morphing into the navigation bar. The complexity of my vision means I've opted for a landing page type approach for now, despite this I believe it's a huge improvement on how the website previously looked. 

In time, I hope to make my website feel more like an extension of myself with respect to the emotions it evokes in visitors. These emotions will be ascertained by interviewing those who know me.

# Part Two
Coming in the future...
