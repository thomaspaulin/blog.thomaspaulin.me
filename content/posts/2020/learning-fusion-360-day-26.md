### Project
2D technical drawings

### Lessons Learned
- Moving the base view will cause any project views except for the perspective view to move too
- The standard and units setting cannot be changes once a new drawing has been created, sheet size can
- Interference edges are useful when model has multiple components which intersect
- Changing settings on the base orthographic image affects all projections, but the inverse is not true
- The specific dimension types only work on certain entities e.g., the diameter or radius dimensions only work on entities with a centre point such as circles and arcs. This means straight lines will not interfere when you try to add dimensions
- Rules for dimensioning
    - Don't duplicate dimensions (don't have dimensions for the left and right side)
    - Use minimum number of dimensions required
    - Never cross dimension lines
    - Fairly intuitive
- Changes in model are propagated to the drawing
