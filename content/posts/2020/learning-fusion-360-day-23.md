### Project
Sculpting a computer mouse

### Lessons Learned
- Kevin recommended using the preset shape closest to your final product
- Turning off other bodies is helpful to avoid confusion when manipulating the mesh
- Mirror - first click selects a face, second click selects a face which is then used to determine where the axis of symmetry is
