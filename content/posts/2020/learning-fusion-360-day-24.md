### Project
Sculpt a pumpkin

### Lessons Learned
- T-spline bodies are not solid
- Ctrl + 1 in Sculpt mode displays faces as boxes rather than smooth curves. Ctrl + 3 to exit. It's easier to select faces in this mode
- You can use alt + the universal scaling tool in sculpt mode (the circle with three arrows) and set the distance to 0 which will close off holes in the T-spline body if the means in the sculpt workspace fail
