### Project
Two part mold

### Lessons Learned
- Combine tool to subtract bodies
- Molding registration pins
- Remember to capture design history when importing so history will be tracked
- Target body when combining is the one who is affected. Cut away in this case
- Can always cut your moulds into smaller pieces but then you risk more lines in the final product where the mold blocks meet
