### Project
Fully constraining sketches

### Lessons Learned
- Sketch on paper
    - Design intent
    - Each design will have different constraints
- Ask yourself: What do I know about the this object without knowing any of the dimensions?
- Clicking on constraint icon will show the type in the bottom right corner of the viewport
- Blue line in sketch = not fully constrained
- Constraints first, dimensions second
    - Fewer dimensions makes updating size easier
- Dimensions have a number. Shown as dX when hover over them
- Can use functions for dimensions e.g., circle half square's dimension - use the dimension number
- Use dimension functions with caution - hard to remember what they represent (can't define variable names/aliases). Performance reasons too in large assemblies?
