## Day 1 - 21 June 2020

### Project

Lego Brick

### Lessons Learned

- Sometimes edges from other objects don't show up and cannot be used. To enable them use the setting Preferences → Design → Auto Project Edges on Reference, or play with the settings in Display Settings → Visual Settings 
- All the edges of a shape will turn from blue to black when it is fully constrained. The sketch icon will also have a red padlock when viewed in the Fusion 360 Brower (I didn't learn this in the day 1 episode, but instead in another of Kevin's videos which led me to this course)
