### Project
Phone case

### Lessons Learned
- When importing a model from elsewhere right click on the project root and select "capture design history" otherwise Fusion will treat you changes as "direct modelling" not "history based design"
- Extend can extend lines straight until they meet another sketch geometry
- With extrude you can manually select which bodies to cut or extrude
- With the project tool you can project geometry from bodies to create new sketches

### Completed Project
[iPhone X case](https://a360.co/2C6yde8)
