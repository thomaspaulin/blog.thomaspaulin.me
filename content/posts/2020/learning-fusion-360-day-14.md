### Project
Flat head screwdriver

### Lessons Learned
- You can select the axes under the origin section of the Fusion 360 browser window. Useful if the axis is hidden by bodies
- Patterning is more efficient OUTSIDE of sketching. i.e. from the "Create â†’ Pattern" menu
    - Sketch pattern tries to duplicate the geometry, pattern outside of sketching mimics bodies/features instead
- New components are nested within whichever component is currently selected
- All for the extrusion extent ensures the extrude is updated if the shank is changed instead of requiring a manual update of the extrusion
