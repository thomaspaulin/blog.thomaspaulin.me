### Project
Animating a toy tank assembly

### Lessons Learned
- Animating how a design should be operated or assembled, not a fully fledged animation package
- Animation commands only work on components, not bodies
- 'Scratch zone' or the column left of 00:00:00 is where the playhead should go if you don't want to record actions e.g., changing your view
- Annotations will appear in the final recording
- View changes are recorded by default

### Completed Project
