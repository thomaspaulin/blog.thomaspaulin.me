### Project
Render a utility knife

### Lessons Learned
- Applying appearances is possibly by dragging and dropping the texture onto the body/component in the Fusion 360 browser
- PANTONE colours are supported by going through the 'Color Library'
- Appearance materials are for appearance only, they do not affect the model's physical properties unlike the physical properties. The latter being crucial when running simulations or analyses

### Completed Project
