### Project
Beer bottle from reference image

### Lessons Learned
- Pressing tab after defining a line length will lock it so you can move the line without changing its length
- Pressing ESC when using splines does not cancel out of the tool like with most, instead it also deletes the spline that has been created since the tool was activated. Press Enter or click the green checkmark to confirm the path
- If you want to join faces with a spline, you'll need to make lines which are joined by the spine. If you attempt to make a face from the spline it will not be a planar face and thus you cannot fillet the edge or extrude, etc etc. Example here is the top of the beet bottle which needed to be make from a line and not the spline which forms the side
