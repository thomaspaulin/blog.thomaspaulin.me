As with many, I have had a bucket list for some time but I often found myself falling back on my laurels and neglecting it. [Enter the Impossible List](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/). The Impossible List was the brainchild of [Joel Runyon](https://joelrunyon.com/) from [IMPOSSIBLE](https://impossiblehq.com/) and aims not to be a bucket list, but a list of seemingly impossible challenges. The primary idea is that the list constantly evolves over time with you, so that which seemed impossible yesterday, is now your new normal today. Most importantly though, the impossible list demands regular action.

I first discovered the Impossible List on 6th April 2018 when I stumbled across an [Indie Hackers podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/047-joel-runyon-of-impossible?utm_source=Indie+Hackers+Newsletter&utm_campaign=indie-hackers-newsletter-20180330) featuring Joel. A day later, on 7 April 2018 I found [Thomas Frankâ€™s adaptation](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) which I have borrowed and adapted for myself.
