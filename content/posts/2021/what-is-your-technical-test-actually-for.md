A recent discussion with a senior engineer on my team prompted me to think about the technical tests used when recruiting new (software) engineers.

A technical test is some exercise intended to gauge a candidate's technical expertise. Usually in the form of a coding challenge or a theoretical exam. 

With application fraud running rampant (citation needed) companies need a way to filter out those who have the skills from those who do not. Historically, references served this purpose, but they can be subject to cronyism. A hiring manager could always talk to a candidate's former colleagues who have no incentive to lie but this isn't always possible. So what? The probationary period can reveal issues with a new hire, unfortunately, by then the company has already committed resources to this new hire and dismissed other candidates. Time and money down the drain. The next obvious step in the hiring process, therefore, is an objective test. Enter the technical test.

Do we need such a test? Yes, it will let us understand where a candidate is **right now** and what they can bring to the company **right now** but tomorrow isn't now and we are hiring for the long term. Or are we? If we are hiring for the short term where we want technical expertise with our technology stack right now then a (well-formulated) technical test could prove useful. If we are hiring for the long term then don't we want someone with high growth potential? Can technical tests show us who will grow the most? For that, a conversation seems best. A conversation where we listen to their responses. Not hear, but truly listen. Listen to the words they use and how they use them - that way we can assess both their knowledge of the fundamental software engineering principles and their mindset.

To do assess their knowledge in this manner means asking the right questions. Finding the right questions is difficult and is summed up nicely in the words of Olympic weightlifter, Jerzy Gregorek: "Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life". Asking the right questions is hard on our part, but do it right and we're bound to find candidates that fit our needs. Some might even argue not doing so is disrespectful to candidates.

I'm not convinced most technical tests ask the right questions, nor are they trying to. It seems to me that most are intended as filters. Most, in my experience, are there to filter out candidates who lack the skills. So why do we seem to dish them out without consideration of an individual's circumstances? Especially after we've already conducted the first interview? Is it part of our Standard Operating Procedure? If so, why? Why would someone with 15 years of continuous employment at reputable companies need to take a rudimentary test? I'm not saying years of experience are linked to ability, they certainly aren't, but if someone has survived 15 years in the industry then surely they are doing something right. Why then should they take a test with beginner level 'gotchas'? (See: individual circumstance). Do we not trust the rest of the industry? If not, why not? What if our ideal candidate happens to be a single mother? She is unlikely to have time to take a four-hour coding test outside of her full-time job. Do we take the dogmatic approach and issue the test anyway? Do we give a reduced scope one to take her situation into account? Are we then testing the same things? Is there any point in us issuing this different test?

What is the purpose of our technical test? Once we are consciously aware of that we can consider whether it serves its purpose and improve or remove it as necessary.âˆŽ
