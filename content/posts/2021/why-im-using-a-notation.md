As anyone who has spent time reading old blogs knows it's merely a matter of time before a link breaks.

This ["link rot"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) [(a)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210113085016/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) can happen for a number of reasons but regardless of its cause one thing is for certain: it has a negative impact on the reader's experience should they wish to follow the links.

Websites such as [archive.org]([https://web.archive.org/save/](https://web.archive.org/save/))* offer one solution by creating an archived version of the link. 

Archived links are a good solution for keeping links alive, however, the original author no longer receives the traffic they deserve. In my opinion this is on par with using an artists work without giving them credit. As such using archived links alone is not acceptable.

This lead me to search for other solutions. Because I'm using a [generator](https://gohugo.io/) [(a)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210112001332/https://gohugo.io/) to create this site why not build a plug-in for it? The plugin will look for rotten links and replace them with archived ones. That way the author gets traffic until it's physically impossible. Doing so would hide whether the link is the original website or an archived version from the reader, something they aren't concerned with. The downsides are that it adds significant complexity and is not appropriate for all blogging platforms. While the latter solution is only a problem when sharing the solution with others, the former means I run the risk of encountering dead links until I can build the plug-in. As such an interim solution is required.

The same day I had this plug-in idea I was reading posts on [Alexey Guzey's website]([https://guzey.com/](https://guzey.com/)) [(a)]([https://web.archive.org/web/20201221083902/https://guzey.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201221083902/https://guzey.com/)) where I noticed so called "(a) notation" in the footer. This construct piqued my curiosity and when I read the articles he linked to about this notation, I was convinced. 

(a) notation solves my problems in a simple manner that is applicable for everyone. It does this by adding an archive link in the form of "(a)" after every link. [Milan Griffes describe it in more detail]([https://www.flightfromperfection.com/(a).html](https://www.flightfromperfection.com/(a).html)) [(a)]([https://web.archive.org/web/20210113084039/https://www.flightfromperfection.com/(a).html](https://web.archive.org/web/20210113084039/https://www.flightfromperfection.com/%28a%29.html)).

What if the archiving website goes down, or a website holder requests their page be removed? The naive answer would be to have another archive for a level of redundancy, but at what point do we stop? The line has to be drawn somewhere.

\* Archiving the archiver within itself makes little sense.
