## Why Rocket Don’t Need Oxygen

As many articles and videos throughout the internet explain, a rocket moves in accordance with Newton’s third law of motion by ejecting matter, in one direction so that the reaction force produces motion in the opposite.

Rockets combine a fuel with an oxidiser, then combust the mixture to produce hot gases. This exhaust acts as the ejected matter and voila! You have thrust.

Some sources explain this using the analogy of an air-breathing jet engine. They describe the ability of rockets to operate in the absence of air by stating that unlike jet engines, rockets “[must take the oxygen with them](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/rocket/TRCRocket/practical_rocketry.html)”. While this is accurate of operational rockets (at the time of writing) this isn’t technically correct and is disproven by [chlorine trifluoride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24637). In 1948, Bert Abramson of Bell Aircraft fired chlorine trifluoride using hydrazine as a fuel. To understand how we can fire a rocket engine without oxygen we must first understand how rockets propellants produce energy.

Rocket propellants store their energy as chemical energy. [Chemical energy itself is stored in the bonds between the atoms of the propellant](https://www.britannica.com/science/chemical-energy). To release this energy, we must break those bonds and free the electrons and ions within. In doing so we concern ourselves with electrons and their movements, meaning we enter into the realm of [redox reactions](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Analytical_Chemistry)/Electrochemistry/Redox_Chemistry/Oxidation-Reduction_Reactions). 

One of the major players within redox chemistry is the oxidising agent, or oxidiser. This is where our rocket oxidiser gets its name. Oxidisers are any chemical species that lose their electron(s) in a reaction. No limitations regarding oxyen are made. Two examples of oxidisers are oxygen and the chlorine trifluoride we mentioned earlier.

If any molecule which loses its electron(s) can be our oxidiser, what properties make for a good oxidiser? In reality, the decision is a series of compromises where we consider a host of factors depending on the intended use. These factors include: energy released by the reaction, reaction time, freezing point, safety, production, cost, and more. In theory, we seek an oxidising agent that releases as much energy as possible. So in the realm of idealism and hypotheticals, oxygen need not be present.
