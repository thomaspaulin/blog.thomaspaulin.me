# Content Archiving
Part of the fight against link rot.

The whitelist (`reliable_hosts.txt`) will be filled with reliable websites, those hosting web applications, or other pages which don't make sense to archive.

The `ignorable_urls.txt` file contains all URLs which are known to be broken can be safely ignored. They include cases such as false positives. They will contribute towards the ignored count, but won't contribute towards the broken count, nor will they show up in the list of broken URLs.
